# whats-for-dinner
A repository of recipes to subvert the processed/prepared food industry and eat well while doing it
Following the global rise in food prices in the first half of 2022 and indications that prices are just gonna keep going up, I've created a collaborative community recipe repo to help you find and share budget-friendly home recipes.
All recipes posted are in the public domain worldwide in perpetuity, because you can't own food, man.
Want to join? Great! Let me know and I will add you as a collaborator.
Don't want to join but have a recipe you want added? Great! Let me know and I'll include it.

RULES
1. This is a COLLABORATIVE COMMUNITY, we're here to make the world a better (and tastier) place. Treat your peers like you'd want to be treated.
1.5 Hate speech, sexism, misogyny, racism, and all other forms of bigotry will not be tolerated. No warnings given, you will be removed from the project if you are in violation of this rule.
2. There is not, nor will there ever be, restictions on types of food and ingredients.
3. Please don't include non-food recipes. This repo is to help people figure out what to cook.
4. Don't yuck somebody else's yum, literally.
5. Have fun and don't burn down the kitchen.
